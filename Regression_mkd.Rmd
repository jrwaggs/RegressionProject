### Overview of the DataSet
  The raw dataset is comprised of information describing all loans issued by LendingClub between 2007 and 2011. The data set can be found at 
  https://www.lendingclub.com/foliofn/rateDetail.action . A more focused data set was then created by selecting all records of failed loans,(i.e. where loan_status was recorded as "Charged Off",) and the following features:

  - **loan_amnt** - The original principal loan amount.
  + **term - Term** length of the loan: 36 or 60 months.
  + **int_rate** - Interest rate of the loan.
  + **inq_last_6mths** - # of inquiries on the borrowers credit report in the last 6 months
  + **sub_grade** - The loan subgrade assigned by Lending club: A1 (best) to G5 (worst.)
  + **home_ownership** - The borrowers ownership status: Rent, Mortgag or Own.
  + **annual_inc** - The borrowers annual income in USD.
  + **purpose** - General purpose for the loan: 1 of 15 categories.
  + **dti** - The borrower's debt-to-income ratio
  + **total_pymnt** - total principal + interest received before the loan was charged off.
  + **total_rec_prncp** - total principal received before the loan was charged off.
  + **pct_paid** - percent of loan principal paid: total principal paid/loan amount.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

We feature drinks and cocktails that hearken back to the Prohibition and Big Band eras, in a return to the elegance of that time. We are the only bar in several towns with a full-size music stage, and we feature at least one band every weekend (mostly blues, bluegrass and rockabilly, although we have had other styles in). We would like to expand into having bands every Friday and Saturday night, as well as an open mic during the week. The owner has experience running a tavern, and he has tons of great ideas for expansion. In addition, he has created jobs for eight other people by starting this business, to say nothing of supporting local bands. The business is up and running, but we are in need of working capital for things like advertising and paying for bands. It is a classy place, and we're already starting to make a name for ourself in our town. We're doing our part to revitalize our downtown area. The owner is already a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and we participate in city chamber events. I have been at my job for over fourteen years, so our ability to repay is secure. We just need some capital to really get things up off the ground. Thank you so much for considering our loan<br> Borrower added on 12/08/11 > We would also like to open the kitchen up and serve appetizers and snacks. There is a full kitchen, with no equipment.

Also, we are paying a higher monthly amount on a car loan. By consolidating the car loan with the home improvement loan, we are aiming at having just one lower, comfortable monthly payment for both things.<br><br>I've been at my current employer's  for over 15 years. Since we've been advised to do the remodels to the home before we move in, we are still in our rental. In the area of expenses, I'm currently paying $1,250 in rent (last rent payment will be in Dec. 2011) and $573 on our car loan. Our only debts are the car loan (we only have one car) and our brand new mortgage of just under $650 (principal and interest). Our first mortgage payment is due in Jan 2012. By paying off the car loan and consolidating this amount with the home improvement amount, I will only have to pay $548 for my full loan with Lending Club. This means that it will be easy for me to pay back the loan without any problems at all.<br><br>In the past, we ran into some financial problems because (1) we did not budget for expenses, (2) we had no savings set aside, and (3) we often spent more than we earned--either because of mismanagement or unforeseen expenses/emergencies. Happily, a couple of years ago, we took a personal finance managing class that equipped us with the knowledge and insight we needed to change our habit and become good money managers. Now, (1) we have a budget and we stick to it; (2) we set aside savings every month for large upcoming expenses and for emergency deductibles; and (3) we don't buy much on credit at all, and when we do, we pay off any credit card statement balances by due date.<br><br>I will be happy to answer any other questions you may have. Thank you for your consideration and  support. Your help  is much appreciated.

I have recently purchased a new home, and as closing is coming to an end I am trying to fill the residence with up to date appliances, furnishings as well as minor repairs. This will hopefully ease the transition for my family and I with moving from one place to another by establishing a permanent residence. For those curious about my credit my current score is 667 through TransUnion. There may be an item listed for a late payment but it is in the process of being corrected (Equifax) due to clerical errors. I have never failed to meet the requirements on a financial agreement nor have I declared bankruptcy.

I am a Federal Employee (22 years) and have incredibly strong job security, which is rare in these days.  I track all my expenses in Quicken, know my budget and always stay within my means.  I use credit cards only for online purchases, flights, or major purchases.  Unfortunately, I have had to make several major purchases over the past year.  I did not have fix rate credit cards, and with today's economy, many of them increased my interest rate by as much as 13%.  Also, as far as being responsible, I keep to a tight budget, and use Quicken to track my expenses so I can work out averages and budget my expenses.  I do not spend more than I can afford to pay, and when I do have to apply for loans it usually is only for a better &quot;financial strategy&quot; to obtain a lower interest rate.

In addition to traditional remodel, we are planning to launch our kitchen makeover service this month. This service features in-house design and construction, as well as a streamlined specification process and thourough project planning on the front end to eliminate unknowns and material delays during construction, allowing us to execute a shorter duration, smoother running project, which results in a more affordable project.

I didn't care how much I spent or where it came from or went to. I also used to &quot;hook&quot; people up all the time with nothing to show for it except more debt. I've since grown up and learned much about managing one's personal finances. I need to clean up my act and get things under control. I strongly prefer not to negotiate with my lenders / banks to bring my debt load down because A, I can afford to pay it off in full and honor my commitments. And B, I've never made a late payment. As far as my repayment record goes, I'm spotless. I also usually try to pay a little extra each month but with this much debt and the big minimum payments, that was becoming increasingly more difficult. I don't want this stain on my credit history.

My income was slightly lower at the time so I couldn't get the full amount needed to consolidate.  My income is better now and since Citi Bank and GE Money Bank raised my interest rate on my 2 remaining credit cards (only 2 with balances that revolve), I'd like to just &quot;wrap those up&quot; with the current Lending Club  loan I have (which I pay on time with no problem every month). <br/><br/>My FICO:<br/><br/>Experian - 786 (per Wells Fargo internal)<br/>Equifax - 792 (per www.myfico.com)<br/>Transunion - 791 (per www.myfico.com)<br/><br/>Breakdown:<br/><br/>$18,000 total<br/>(10,511 to pay off/refi Lending Club)<br/>(4800 to pay Citi) - Charging me 18.99% interest.  They &quot;kindly&quot; lowered it from 26.99%. How nice. <br/>(1700 to pay GE Money Bank) - Interest rate is 23.99%. <br/><br/><br/>Why 60 month term? <br/>-Flexibility is key.  I'm in the financial service industry and nothing is ever certain as you can imagine.  As much as I'd love to go 36 months at a lower rate, I'd feel safer doing a 60 month term just in case.  I have enough in reserves to cover a $400 payment for this loan for 12 months along with fixed expenses.  <br/><br/>Why didn't I ask for the 18k the first time?<br/>-Great question. To be honest, I was a little naive and just assumed I wouldn't get approved.  I also wasn't sure how Lending Club worked and was tentative to &quot;put all my eggs in one basket&quot; so to speak.  In hindsight, it wasn't the smartest decision as I've ended up paying more in interest due to my tentativeness.  Now I'm ready to wipe all of these credit cards off! <br/><br/>Is my job safe?<br/>- Wells Fargo has been around since 1852. I am doing very well here and out of all the banks, Wells Fargo seems to be the most stable in terms of job security.  <br/><br/>Why Should You Invest In Me?<br/>- Because I'm essentially a guaranteed return.  I have funds in reserves to cover me should anything happen to my job.  I have a low debt to income ratio (20-26%).  I have no mortgage or rent.  I have inclining income, stable job, AND residence.  Last and certainly not least, I have perfect pay history with all lenders, MOST IMPORTANTLY, with Lending Club.  I have never been late on any payments on any debt...ever.  <br/><br/>More questions?

The monthly payments on these debts are more than the monthly payments needed to service the monthly payments for the requested loan. As the sole co-signer for a college loan for I am responsible for a past due balance on one of two loans which requires ongoing payments although my son is still enrolled as a full time student. The loan I am requesting will be used to cover the delinquency on the loan which is over 120 days past due. <br/><br/>(2) The only delinquency on my credit profile is related to this past due payments on the loan and has had a negative impact on my credit rating. When many of my creditors (particularly the banks) lowered my overall available credit (in one case by as high as 90%) to levels close to my overall balances my credit rating was negatively impacted. This put my overall balances closer to my overall credit limits although I did not incur any additional debt. With just this, one-change creditors drastically affected the credit profile of many consumers who were otherwise in good standing.

Additionally after having the AC/Heat pump and Water Heater checked, I am upgrading now as to take advantage of the tax credits, gov't rebates, and power company rebates and going to be able to save an average of $135 on my monthly power bill.  So by combining all of this into one loan I will save about $328 per month and be able to add even more into my savings every month.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your help in funding my loan quickly!  Hopefully soon I can return the favor and help other borrowers by being on the lending side!

This is the perfect business investment loan to invest in for many reasons:<br/>1.  Managing a DVD Now Kiosk does not require me to quit my full-time job.<br/>2. DVD Kiosks are growing faster than any other vending opportunity in the market today.<br/>3. DVD Now competes with Red Box by offering Blue Ray and video games, which Red Box does not offer. Also Red Box only works with large chains like Wal-Mart.  My plan is to put Kiosks on college campuses, which Red Box doesn't touch.<br/>4. DVD Kiosks are set to explode.  Brick and mortar stores are closing and are being replaced by Kiosks which are much cheaper to run, yet can still bring in almost as much revenue.<br/>5. Investing in DVD Kiosks now is like investing in ATM machines in the early 80s, we are now in the ground floor stage.<br/>6. I have a degree in business, and over 7 years of sales, route sales, and inventory management experience.  All of which will help me with this endeavor.<br/>7.  Red Box kiosks have 3 revenue streams, as opposed to Red Box's one: rentals.

During the housing boom, I took a chance with the stock market with easy 0% to 5% line of credits.  It wasn't good during this time, it was GREAT, my portfolio was looking awesome.  Then the housing collapse, the credit meltdown, and dow jones fell.  I never missed my minimum payments but I never bother to pay the credit cards balance off either.  So after 3 years, I am still alive and kicking with high balances and high mimimum payments.  I always pay my bills and don't regret going for the big money during the boom.  I finally decided to consolidate my credit cards into one bill.  I just don't want to have to worry about what those credit cards are trying to scam next with late fees, higher APRs, annual fees, etc.... to try to keep me their financial servant.  I was against it for a while due to horror stories of debt consolidation or reduction.  However, I am not looking for a write-off, I am looking for a loan without risking my house.  I have 2 roommates in a 5 bed/ 3.5 baths house that covers the mortgage &amp; utilities just fine.  My job with the government is very secure and in demand.  I can and will pay this 30K debt down.

According to the NAHB (National Assoc of Home Builders), addition of a bathroom and bedroom can each add 10%-20% to a home???s value.

Per my description on that loan, my plan was to refinance all my credit card debt so that I could reduce total interest and pay off more quickly.  That loan was the first half, now I am doing the second half.  Following the funding of this loan my plan is to reduce my overall open to buy by eliminating some unneeded cards. The goal here is to just refinance the debt as opposed to bringing on new debt.  My income is solid, stable and ample to make payments as I believe my profile will show.  This is primarily a move to optimize the cash that I am paying out each month and create a finite path for pay off.  Funds used to pay this loan are already being spent each month and are allocated to my monthly budget, this will just allow those budgeted dollars to work more effectively.  I have worked in the same industry for 17 years now and have had only two employers (including the current one) during that period.<br/>",credit_card,Credit Card Refinance (Part II),919xx,CA,10.02,0,Jan-91,0,,,8,0,18486,75.50%,17,4722.47,4722.47,2499.11,1791.27,0,432.09,4.06,13-Jan,27.55,16-Oct

I am currently renting my home to my brother with the hopes that he will obtain financing and be able buy it eventually.  I have quite a bit of &quot;roll up&quot; funds available to pay extra on my current debt and as I said earlier, my goal is to become debt free quickly.  Before paying extra, however, I need to use the extra funds to build the emergency fund needed to cover any unexpected expenses without using credit at all.  This is the &quot;3 to 6 months of income&quot; recommended.  I have recently &quot;paid off&quot; 2 bills and have used the extra funds to begin to pay off the next one on the list.  One of my creditors recently increased my interest rate for &quot;profitability purposes&quot; which baffles me as the big banks make so much money already.  With the new consumer credit laws in effect, the banks need to find ways of keeping their income at the levels they are used to and unfortunately this is also affecting some of the smaller community banks and credit unions.  I would rather pay any interest to personal investors as opposed to a select group of stockholders who do not know my situation, goals and plan for personal growth.  Another goal is to become debt free while at the same time increasing my credit score to above 800.  Being debt free to me will mean that I can make the kinds of choices that benefit my family and my community and will enable me to spend my time focusing on worthwhile projects without worry.  If the loan is not funded fully, I will continue with my current plan to become debt free (within 3 years, if not sooner)...This loan will help create momentum and peace of mind.

Even after threatening to take my business elsewhere, they were still unwilling to work with me. I would love to have this loan funded and be able to pay off and close these credit card accounts as soon as possible so that these companies do not receive anymore of my money. <br/>I am an honest and hardworking nurse and student.  I have recently completed a personal finance course that has gotten me excited about investing in my future.  I would love to be able to be free of debt and credit cards to have more to invest in retirement and savings. PLEASE fund my loan so that I can make that happen.

My history is as follows: 4 years with the U.S. Air Force, where I was trained in graphic design. I have been consistently employed as a graphic designer since exiting the Air Force in 1996. I have been with my current company (full time) since March 2001. My wife is also employed at a local dog boarding kennel since March 2008 as the manager. Her experience in animal care began in 1996, at a local veterinary hospital where she spent the next 9 years. Her exit from this location was amicable one, as she was offered to help another doctor open his 2 new practices. This took approximately 2 years, from there she was offered yet another venture of opening the kennel of a National pet store chain. After several years of working overtime for others in order to run their business's, we decided that she could have been working this hard to open her very own place. We are grateful for all the experience she has had in the blood, sweat and tears of opening a new business but we are ready to sweat for ourselves. I have no plans to leave my current full time job anytime in the near future, and my wife will be working at her current job, up until it is no longer humanly possible after opening our own location. This was not decided quickly or lightly, especially in these economic times. Thankfully, we remain employed and are able to pay our bills and mortgage on time. We've spent the past 8 months reading, researching and questioning other business owners in our area and have received excellent advice and feedback on our &quot;dream&quot; and we are ready to put her experience in the pet care industry to use.

I have no dependents, so for me, budgeting will be much easier also.  What makes a good risk is simply this:  I believe that I didn't have to chase anyone to get my loan; so no bank, investor or institution should have to chase me to get it back. The terms of my loan are very reasonable, and I'm more than willing to keep my end of the bargain.  Outside of my credit card bills, there are only my monthly recurring bills to pay(rent, cable, SDG&amp;E, etc.) and even will the loan payment thrown in, I can still manage to live within my means. I live on a fixed income, but as I have said, I have done the paper and pencil work, so I know what I'm getting myself into.  If you have any questions or anything I can clarify, please don't hesitate to place your question and I will answer to the best of my knowledge and as timely as I can.

Current interest rates range for 12.90% to 26.99%. I will also be paying off the balance of my car of $14,900.00 with a payment of $683.00. Total of all debt to be paid off is $33,900.00 at payments at $1,188.00.<br/>Payment on the new loan should be $880.00 which shows a monthly debt savings of $308.00 per month, I should be able to apply this savings towards the new loan to shorten the term from 5 years to somewhere around 3.5 to 4 years.<br/>  <br/>What makes me a good borrower? I make a decent income of about $115,000.00 per year selling new homes for a large builder in a market that&rsquo;s been down but is now on its way back. While the housing market has been soft I have not had a decree in my income and my credit has not suffered. The large part of the debt is from my ex-wife which I took to help her knowing that she would not be able to pay which could affect my credit. I have never been late making payments on any of my debts and intend to keep it that way.<br/><br/>With this new loan my budget is simple, my mortgage payment is $1,780.00 and the new loan of $880.00 totals $2,660.00. My monthly income before taxes is around $9,400.00 per month so after my monthly obligations of $2,660.00 leaves me over $6,700 for living expenses, savings and investments. The main goal for this loan is to get out from under the credit card lenders and their high rates as well as getting the debts from my ex wife paid off.<br/>  <br/>Regarding my job stability, last year was one of my highest income years since I have been in the new home building market, 9 years total and each year is better for me. I just had my yearly review from corporate and I have been asked to open a new subdivision in one of the area&rsquo;s best markets so my income is projected to rise again.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/> Borrower added on 02/12/11 > The following is the break down of my current debt;<br/>Chase, $1,664 - 26.99% - $56 min<br/>Chase, $5,798 - 25.24% - $180 min<br/>Sears, $720 - 25.24% - $15 min<br/>USAA AMEX, $4,955 - 15.9% - $117 min<br/>Capital One, $1,520 - 14.66% - $35 min<br/>Capital One, $80 - 13.40% - $15 min<br/>Household Bank, $4,300 - 12.9% - $90 min<br/>Addison FCU (car), $14,900 - 6.9% - $682.97 monthly<br/><br/>My current mortgage balance is $315,000 and valued about $345,000.<br/><br/>I hope that this additional information is helpful in reaching your decision.<br/><br/>Thank you again.<br/> Borrower added on 02/18/11 > Some additional information for investors;<br/>After using an online debt reduction calculator and inputting the details of the proposed loan I have calculated that I should be able to repay this note as early as 39 months keeping my current payment structure at $1,200.

I have a lot of the money I need saved up, but I owe a bit more than I can afford this year. This is primarily because I pay my mother's rent. She lost her job about a year ago and I help her with the money I would've otherwise used to pay taxes. She's also getting older (she's 57) so I'm working on increasing how much I make this year so I can take care of her and she won't have to go back to work. Right now she's on unemployment.<br/><br/><br/>What makes me a good borrower?<br/><br/>I've always been determined and worked hard. I am self-employed simply out of hard work, God's blessing(s) and because I kept going when it felt like I wasn't getting anywhere.<br/><br/>I'm a Christian and I pay my bills on time. My credit history is good. I value good credit and I am responsible for the money I owe. I was raised with these values and have always respected the property in my care, the money I owe and I'm grateful for the help I'm given. Responsibilty is a gift and I think it's important not to abuse it.<br/><br/>What is my monthly budget?<br/><br/>I'm not sure how exactly to answer this. After paying my bills and saving out for taxes, my disposable income is around $300-400/mo.<br/><br/>How stable is my job?<br/><br/>My job is really stable. I'm self-employed so no one can fire me from my job. I've been self-employed for the last 5 years. My primary income, at the moment, comes from one website. My income comes from advertisements on my site and affiliate commissions.<br/><br/>I have several other small sites I've built that make me additional income from advertisements. I am now currently building more websites that make money through advertisements and ultimately I plan to invest in additional e-businesses that sell digital goods, etc.<br/><br/>My home-business is just one aspect of all the things I want to do with my life.<br/> Borrower added on 02/08/11 > What is my monthly income?<br/><br/>I think may be what was meant by &quot;What is my monthy budget&quot; -- so I'm answering the question as thoroughly as I can.<br/><br/>I earn between $3300-3600/mo.<br/><br/>Monthly Debts:<br/><br/>Rent: $575/mo<br/>Credit Cards: $730/mo<br/>Utilities: $200/mo<br/>Phone: $80/mo<br/>School Loan: $182/mo<br/>Mom's Rent: $440/mo<br/>Taxes: $700/mo<br/>------------<br/>Total:  $2907<br/><br/>(Remaining money is disposable income of $300+)<br/> Borrower added on 02/08/11 > Most of my credit card debt was also prior to when my business took off.

Mom had to hold the family together. The funds from the policy on the boy, paid the bills and let the family stay in their house until dad could recover and get a new job.

A fair portion will go towards the ring and the rest will be spent on our trip to Hawaii.  We have been living together for the past 4 years and we both feel that it is time to tie the knot. It's either now or never.  I have stable employment working a desk job for a passenger transportation company for the past three years. I see a major promotion for me on the horizon.  She is a state-certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) and has two more semesters before she earns her RN (Registered Nurse). Her projected starting salary in her new job is double my current income.  We do in fact have the cash on hand to fund the wedding without this loan, but would rather pay the interest and not pillage our rainy-day fund.  This will be my second loan with Lending Club. I paid off my first loan a few months early. At this APR, I do not intend to repay this one prematurely.  We attempt to live as frugal as possible. Cost of living in Arizona is rather affordable.  An example of our monthly budget is as follows: 650.00 Housing (2 bedroom apartment) 200.00 Sustenance 250.00 Transportation (2 economy cars, both paid for) 100.00 Entertainment 100.00 Shopping 120.00 Commuication (mobile phones, no land-line) 100.00 Savings (contribution to our emergency fund)  This budget is split between the two of us. My portion is only 760.00. If you add this loan, that brings my budget to just shy of $900.00 per month which is quite affordable for us. That is why I am a great candidate for your investment.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. I will respond as quickly as possible. Borrower added on 01/20/11 > It looks like this loan is going to be 100% funded.

Now that I have regained my strength after chemo and radiation I have the energy to get these bills paid off!!  I battled cancer for a year without taking any time off from work because I am very lucky to have a career that is not physically straining and I knew I needed to keep from drowning in doctor bills.  I am a very dependable person, I have paid off many accounts in my past including 3 new car loans.  My credit has been dropping because of unpaid doctor bills and too many maxed out credit cards in the last couple of years.  I am trying to dig myself out of a hole that keeps caving in.  My dad always said don???t get credit cards, I wish I would have listened!  If I could get this loan thru LendingClub I would pay off 4 credit cards with rates over 20%, two doctor bills and a timeshare loan and get myself out of debt in 3 years at the most but hopefully sooner.  Please help me be debt free faster!  Without the LendingClub loan I feel like I might be in debt to these companies forever.

I am a young IT professional with a stable job history and zero dependents, which allows me to maintain a strict budget. I adhere to a budget, which allows only $240.00 p/month of discretionary spending, $300 p/month for groceries, $675 p/month for rent/utilities, and $300 p/month for student loans and transportation and the remainder falls into a variety of savings categories. Furthermore, I utilize automatic electronic payment/deduction methods to ensure my bills are paid on time.<br/> Borrower added on 01/01/11 > Additional Information that May be Helpful to Know: <br/>The debt that I am interested in consolidating is not all listed in my credit report (one account is). The debt are personal loans by a private investor (aka family member) on their CREDIT CARDS for medical and moving expenses, etc. Their interest rate on their credits cards is high at this point due to their own credit struggles (19.99 to 29.99%) and my one retail card is also high (24.99). Therefore, I would like to consolidate these loans to allow for both increased savings and ease of payment. If I am unable to obtain full funding, I would very much consider partial funding in order to pay off the higher rate debt. I would much rather obtain a loan to pay these debts and keep savings for emergencies/cushion, than pay them off and have no emergency savings (especially given the current economic climate). <br/><br/>Below are the approximate balances on the debt I am interested in consolidating:<br/>A: 6700<br/>B: 3600<br/>C: 3700<br/>D. 634<br/>E. 2500<br/><br/>Also, of note, although my car loan is currently approximately 298 p/month.

My principal balance is $128,262.20 per statement dated 10/29/10. Monthly payments for principal, interest, taxes and insurance (piti) are $976.81. My monthly payments in '09 were $1K as the closing &quot;adjustments&quot; had not raised piti payments until Jan. 2010. Since then my monthly payments have been $1.1K, hence these otherwise incalculable (questionable) lower principal uncertainties may thus simply clarify and reinforce my credit standing. I have upgraded since arrival with a poured concrete sidewalk from driveway to existing back concrete walk and a &quot;slate style&quot; finished, curving contoured concrete patio outside the sliding glass doors, replacing that end of the original concrete walk out to the edge of the house in February. Also, a microwave oven was installed above the range this summer. <br/><br/>Negotiations with new neighbors on both sides are underway to replace the back/side fence &amp; gate for our corner with highest grade and quality available by permit.

I have been faithfully paying these credit cards on time every month ever since I opened them 4 years ago. At no fault of my own I have watched my interest rates escalate. All but one of them now have an APR of more than 21%! Earlier this year I attempted to get a credit union credit card and perform a balance transfer, however the financial representative wanted me to pay them down by $3,000.00 and for me to then apply again once I had done this. <br/><br/>I have developed the useful habit of paying bills online with automation for several years. This has helped me stay current with all of my bills and in good standing with all of my creditors.<br/><br/>I need to pay off all of these credit cards so that I can reach my other financial goals. My top financial goal, next to having zero credit card debt, is to establish an emergency fund. I also want peace of mind and to make more of my money by not putting liens on my future income. I want to control my finances and pay cash for things. I will close all of these credit cards except for one. I will not carry a balnce on this card. I will use it with merchants/servicers who only accept credit cards and this will also help me maintain a mix of different types of credit for my FICO score.<br/><br/>I currently allocate $454.00 per month in my budget towards debt repayment. If I were to get this loan, the repayment would be $359.00. I would have almost a $100.00 surplus every month from just the debt repayment allocation in my budget.

I suspected as much, as I've got some broken teeth in the back of my mouth, as well as occasional infections that I've fixed over time in peace meal fashion. Due to the fact I don't have insurance, I rarely go to the dentist (a stupid decision in hindsight) But my experience on vacation gave me a wake up call that I need to get all of my issues fixed. Those include at least a few crowns, a route canal, wisdom tooth removal,and other procedures that will take place over a few months.

That loan has  helped me consolidate some of my debt as well, but I also went above and beyond consolidating and outright paid a substantial portion off this year. I have a good history of paying back on time, if not early. The only current debt I have is my car lease, the loan I have with Lending Club now, and a credit line with citi; this loan would be the only new unsecured debt for the year.I encourage you to look my other account up, you will see that in a couple of months,January I believe, that loan will be half paid off. I encourage you to see how I have made consistent, timely payments.  As an individual that has lent money before to friends and family, I am aware of the risk you're taking. And as a borrower too, I would not want to be late on my payments because I do not want my credit to deteriorate, especially in this tight credit environment, but also,it is the right thing to do.  This money will help pay for the unexpected, costly damage to my car,and keep my liquidity in tact.

This comes out to approx $36, 358.00. I need to tell you that I work overtime just about every week. My income so far this year is $45,673.00 for weeks up to 10/18/2010. This also does not include my wife's income. She works 9 months out of the year doing home visits with pre-head-start kids.<br/><br/>I didn't want any investors looking at my debt to income ratio and think that I'm living too tight for comfort. I am not. I've not been late with a payment to any of my creditors for at least 12 years ( may be even more ) and this loan payment will not add any further burden to my monthly output. (See explanation above.)<br/><br/>I wanted to make this clear as I'm in fear that this loan might not go to full 100% funding as the funds just seem to be &quot;trickling&quot; in. I have a long way to go in only 9 days!  I'd hate to think that you did not invest with my loan because of my reported lower earnings than what I actually am making. I reported my &quot;regular&quot; earnings, but I make more than this with my &quot;overtime&quot; earnings.

It's really touching to see people helping me that don't even know me.  I guarantee you, you won't be disappointed; I won't let you down.    <br/><br/>I don't know what information you have about me but, my &quot;loan grade&quot; is where it's at because my debt to income ratio is high.  However, I've never been late paying any of my bills.  Furthermore, I am married, so I do have extra income.  If I get fully funded, I'm going to pay off my accounts with the highest balance and highest interest rates.  I'll be paying close to the same amount every month but my debt will be paid off in five years instead of thirty!  I've <br/>already been paying more than the minimum amount due to the other accounts so, they'll be paid off within the next three <br/>years.<br/><br/>Althouth this may hurt my chances with some of you, some of you may want to know, I'm a police officer.  As a government employee, I have a stable position.  Since I've been employed with the department (for five years), my income has increased $30,000 annually.  It's because I anticipated this extra income that I've accumulated so much debt over the years.  I'm ashamed of how much money I could be saving for retirement or my children's<br/>college but am paying to debt instead.<br/><br/>Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read this.  I really appreciate your time and support.

Because we left our marriages with &quot;nothing&quot; we must purchase bedroom, living room and dining room furniture, a washer and dryer, television and kitchen appliances.  Getting this loan will greatly help in speeding up the process of getting our new home in order.  My husband is a Lieutenant with Loganville Police Department - Chief Detective and plans on retiring from the force.  I am aPayroll Administrator with Genco/Petco and expect that I will retire from my company as well.  Both our jobs and income are quite secure.  We will have no problem repaying the loan.<br/>",home_improvement,Starting Over,300xx,GA,7.8,0,Apr-99,2,76,,6,0,3684,76.70%,9,4589.52,4568.76,3364.37,1224.06,0,1.09,0,12-Nov,28.32,19-Mar

We supply 100% recycled materials to businesses that wish to switch to becoming a green business. We work with the EPA Waste Wise Program and also get certifications for these business that use and buy our products. We supply sustainable goods that effect our Eco and waste systems. We are seeking a 25K loan for expansion as we have 6 over 400 room hotels that want our products in them and we are about to get a major airport as well. The funding is for stock and to hire 2 more sales reps, and because we are a new business our manufacturer is requiring COD for the first 1yr. of our shipments. We have been in business now for 7 months and have made a steady small profit which we put right back into the company. We have a web based sales launch planned for next March as well to bring these great products to the everyday consumer. I personally use all the products in my home. I would appreciate it if you could fund this loan as there are so many outlets for us to sell our products and make this world more green and better with the use of these products to help continue sustainability in our Eco and waste systems for the future. The bank loved our business plan but denied our loan because we were a start up, the catch 22. We have as I have said several National Hotel chains as clients, the airport deal will be done by October 1st and We as a company are growing rapidly and can sustain this loan. Our products are made from a process that is made of and from the bi products of sugar cane. We do paper products, 100% safe cleaners and everything even a restaurant can use for there take out products. I thank you for all of your investors that use this service and request that you fund our loan. Thank you.<br/><br/>We were on the website before, but removed due to a processing glitch in verifying our 4056 form. At that time all of you wonderful people had almost funded our loan request to 100%. We have reposted and ask that you continue to fund us to 100% as it was a glitch with the IRS with processing time to just verify our taxes which has been done now. Again Thank you for everyone that will be funding this loan. Also we have secured another hotel that wants to go and be GREEN in the mean time, while this processing was taking place.

I moved from Maine to Wyoming and I guess I did not let these folks know of my change of address, and frankly with the balances so low I was not aware of them.

My bring home pay each month, including child support, is $3200. Currently, I have $20 taken from each pay check and put into a saving's account and my bank also offers a saving's system which transfers $1 from your checking into saving's for every transaction. In a typical month I can save about $120 between the paycheck deductions and the transaction transfers. <br/>My approximate balances and APRs for credit cards are:<br/>$923  - 29.9%<br/>$2510- 27.9%<br/>$1825- 29.9%<br/>$2081- 26.9%<br/>$1371- 24.9%<br/>$954-   19.1%<br/>$619-    9.9%<br/>$1864- 0% for one year<br/>Unfortunately, a few of these credit card debts ($1864- 0%, and the $1825-29.9%) arose from having a pet with a serious medical condition who died after the $1864 stay at the animal hospital. The rest of the debt was more bearable prior to the last 6 months of medical problems with the dog. <br/>In the last year, I paid off 2 other credit cards and have not used them since then, I didn't close out the accounts because I was told it looks bad on your credit report, so they are just not in use. The rest of this debt I plan on paying off prior to the 5 year payment plan that I chose for this debt consolidation loan. <br/>I am the sole wage earner in my household as I was recently divorced and, unfortunately, the one who kept the debt. This is why it is imperative for me to find a way to reduce my monthly expenses by consolidating these high interest credit card payments. I have two children to care for and plan for their futures, with this credit card debt it is difficult for me to provide for them and save for their futures at the same time. <br/>I am only requesting 8k for the consolidation because the other debts that I owe have lower interest rates than what was offered through the initial loan application process, and I plan on paying off the interest free one when I receive my tax return. <br/>Hope I answered all of your questions!  :)<br/>",debt_consolidation,Amy's Relief,329xx,FL,20.4,0,Sep-95,2,43,,31,0,11712,78.10%,57,3887.64,3887.64,1598.29,2275.13,0,14.22,0,12-Mar,215.98,19-Mar

I&rsquo;d like to introduce myself and explain the purpose of my loan. I&rsquo;m 33 years old and have been paying bills since I was 18. I have never made a late payment on any credit card, car loan, rent, etc. I am not married nor do I have children. I have a great job at a mortgage company that is close to home and has full medical benefits. I&rsquo;ve been working there for six and a half years, the company has been in business for 28 years. You can see their website at www.mountainmortgagecorp.com.<br/><br/>I have a very small monthly budget. Rent $893, Phone and Internet $70, Electric $50, Gas $20, Car Insurance $120, Food $130, Credit Cards $150, Miscellaneous $30. This all totals $1463.<br/><br/>The purpose of my loan is to help me start a side business. I have been a computer programmer since I got out of high school and for the last few years I've been programming game engines for all the major independent gaming platforms (Xbox, Iphone, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, Windows Phone 7, Google, PC, Mac) so I can tap into the booming independent games market. My engines are complete for a number of games with place holder art. The money I wish to borrow would be used for a few different things. First to pay professional artists and musicians to add high quality art and music to the games. To purchase the proper equipment to fully test all the games on all the platforms and operating systems. To pay for professional advertising and viral marketing campaigns. And finally to add professional content to my e-commerce website which will promote/sell the games and merchandise. I'm taking this side business very seriously. This loan amount would cover everything I need to create a very professional presence and ensure quality recognition in the future. If I get this loan quickly I'll have a few of the games out before December and be able to take advantage of all the extra purchases made during the Holiday Season. I think that about covers it. But should anyone have any other questions, please feel free to ask. Thanks!<br/><br/>P.S. I read that it is better to be proactive on the Credit Review Status so I called Lending Club today and asked if there is anything I can do to speed up the process. Their representative told me there wasn't and that I just had to wait for the Credit Review team to get to my file. I hope they get to it soon.

We are DIY remodelers, no $50K kitchens here! The condo needs interior paint, flooring and more attention to the bathroom and kitchen areas to replace old fixtures.  <br/><br/>We also have need of a 2nd car and are looking to have our old reliable minivan repaired or replaced with a &quot;new to us&quot; version. In addition, I will be using these funds to pay off the balance of an old school loan of my wife's so that she can have her transcripts released for the fall in a timely fashion for the university she is attending and to soon schedule needed surgery for one of our beloved dogs.<br/><br/>As a legal permanent citizen of the U.S. (I am a Swedish citizen), I came here with no established credit history and have been working to obtain one. I'm pleased to say my credit history is Good with no delinquencies. I have two MasterCards with modest balances that will be paid down by the end of August (Orchard Bank and CapitalOne), as well as a Fingerhut account with a balance of $295.00. I have also a small personal loan from my credit union that I do not wish to pay off since it is new and I want to establish good history with that loan as well.  I feel that a second installment loan suits my diverse credit need better than applying for more credit cards with higher APRs and annual fees and will help further diversify my credit portfolio while keeping the monthly payment highly manageable. I have been exceptionally diligent about my monthly payments and my credit history should reflect this.  <br/><br/>My job is stable.  I have worked for my company for three years and have received several accolades and bonuses over that term, including an invitation to continue work at the Gillette factory when the main Sonoco packaging plant was due to close this year.  My monthly take home pay has averaged $3K per month for the last two years. I am the primary breadwinner for the family and pay the mortgage for my wife's condo. <br/><br/>My wife lost her job in 2006 and has since received a college degree and started her own freelance writing business this year.

My parents were no longer able to fully pay for my tuition and extra expenses out of pocket, as they had done prior to the economic downfall.  Additionally as I approached the end of my college career, I asked for less and less hours to ensure doing well in my final few classes.  Now that school isn't currently in the picture, and I'm secured in the federal employee system; I anticipate being comfortable paying the potential loan off.  Understandably, I've had skeptical lenders ask questions regarding how I would manage being timely and consistent with payments while moving out if I've been unable to manage this at home with my parents.  In my defense, again as just mentioned, this debt was primarily due to charging my tuition while working less than typical part time hours.  Secondly, I've been managing making at least my minumum payments.  Only twice, I missed my due date, as I overlooked the date and wasn't more than one day delinquent.

That was alot of info i had down about me, maybe to much.  Anyway...  <br/>   Short Version.= I am 31  and i recently became a first time buyer home owner this year.  I had some good luck, I been saving 3 years ago more than half my monthly paycheck been going to my saving account., also about year and half ago i decided to start fixing my credit, it was 561 and to this day it is at a 741.  I have to admit it was perfect timing when I picked out this brand new 3b/2b 2200 sq ft house for 120k. I been planning this out for such a long time.  I gave alot of dedication, money, and work into buying a house, and it payed off. Plus made it in time for the first time buyer tax credit.   I researched what i needed to put down: 20% and found out the closing cost was around 5k.  I been working since the middle of 2003 at our family exporting business to Latin America, With the recession happening our business kept running strong, we all notice some change but kept on moving.  Our company exports fertilizer, insecticides, and pesticides  that are biodegradable and environmentally .safe  for the farms down there.  It is a very good and stable job, people need to eat.  I been living in my new house for about 5-6 months.  I figured that the left over money i had left the buying the house would be enough to get some appliances and improve and upgrade the house.  Well i know now some appliances are up there in price and it isn't the fancy pieces. also started with hardwood flooring in areas and found out the hard way that the money went fast and most of it was for the little things u do not calculate. Everything is perfect with bills and credit cards, since they have low credit.  For some of the projects ( finishing the floors, counter top for the kitcken and fixtures cost some money.  It is very easy for me to make payments, i keep at least 3 weeks -month ahead of all my bills, the 20% down gave me a really good monthly payment rate.  With my great credit score i been pre approve for the credit cards that can help, but after picking 2 and being denied after pre approve it was more hurting me with inquires.  I find it difficult to come up with 2-3k or the full price to have it at that time for somewhat big purchase for the house, np with coming up with 1-1.5k  for a down payment and go with payment but even if i had the money to back it up like always having low credit limit and now Inquiry are adding up are preventing my chance. even with a killer credit score with a mortgage. When i looked at this site going through my credit score online seeing that the payments at 300 is perfect fit in my cycle of bills for each month.  I hope luck is on my side with this just like the house because this pretty much my last hope to get the ball moving.  I have been perfect the last 5 years no late payment nothing to get to were i am at.  I take my credit and monthly payments very seriously.  This loan can finish my sections of wood flooring. grabbing the rest of the pieces to my bed room set, kitchen counter top.  upgrading the fixtures and adding some furinture to the other bedrooms.  It is this loan which i used up a credit inquiry, or ill have to wait for how long when they want raise my credit which some already which i am happy but still low.

My goal is to purchase our first home within six months and credit card utilization plays a big part in FICO scoring. An installment account is scored differently than CCs and this loan would result in a big bump in our FICO scores and thus place us in a better position to get a lower rate.<br/><br/>To summarize my credit reports, all are the same with up to a 13 year history (depending on the report) with an average age of approx 3-4 years. I don't know how much info you can see, but I have a total of 20 accounts on TransUnion with all but 5 being current and open with zero lates. The closed accounts include three closed and paid (in good standing) CCs that were closed due to higher rates and/or fees, and two car loan accounts. Both car loans are paid in full, with the latest being last spring and one followed me from a dark period in my credit history and was a redeemed repo. After the repo, I paid past due amounts and continued until paid in full and that was over 4 yrs ago. The repo occurred over 5 yrs ago with lates leading up to that. I believe there are seven 30 and 60 day lates reporting with the last being 1/2005. Other than that I have no other bad accounts reporting, including no judgments, collections, etc. <br/><br/>Per new credit, I have 8 inquiries reporting on TransUnion but all of them, except for one, are older than 1 yr old and are about to drop from the credit report. The most recent inquiry is 8-9 months old. This is my first and only attempt at a loan.<br/><br/>My monthly income is at $5,260 and I've been with the same company since May of 1997. I worked my way up and have served as president since the start of the year. We are in the commercial services industry (janitorial, security, landscaping, supply sales, etc.) since 1978 and are rebounding at $1.7M/yr, debt free, BTW. Not included in the stats are household income. My wife is a stay-at-home mom to 4 kids, but she earns income by serving on the board for our company. That income is at about $22k/yr. Aside from that, we earned an extra $5300 in reported misc. income last year. <br/><br/>Per DTI, our monthly obligations are the rent ($1000) and CC payments.<br/><br/>Per cash reserves, we have about $2000 in cash available at all times with $35k in a CD saved for our future home. We also have just over $20k in a 401(k).<br/><br/>One question I'd ask is why so much debt and why is your CC utilization so high? Over the past year, my wife didn't have (well, we didn't have) health insurance. Despite that, come 2 weeks ago, kiddo #4 came and we paid the hospital in cash. Felt great, but I used CCs as a crutch over the past many months. To compund things, I had over $8000 in credit with DSNB (Macys and Bloomies) and they made a change in CC reporting and stopped reporting the credit limits. That shot my CC utilization up by 35% overall in one day. Thankfully, I only had balances on two of the accounts, one of which recently got paid off and has yet to report. Last year, I added an Amex Green and funnelled all purchases on that card. That forces me to pay in full monthly all the while chipping away at the remaining CC balances (approx 10 of 20 accounts have balances). <br/><br/>I probably typed too much, but wanted to be thorough.<br/> Borrower added on 07/09/10 > I wanted to give an update...I called today and they had already received everything they needed.

I have not settled for two reasons.  One, I haven't finished treatment, and two, they have offered to settle for only $70,000.  That sounds like a lot, but it does not cover the financial damage of eight years of medical expenses that I have had to fund out of my own pocket.<br/><br/>I have been putting together my final set of documentation to submit, but Iâve reached the end of my claim period and to keep the claim open, I must file suit.  My claim is also against my own insurance company, whom I have been with for 30 years.

I don't agree with the personal injury contingency approach to settling an accident claim.  <br/>I need one now to file suit and to provide advice on a few key issues because of the push-back Iâm getting.  I have no intention of going to court, but I do expect to go to mediation. <br/><br/>I believe the claim is worth at least $100,000 and perhaps more.  Why do I believe that now?

I believe in people who do the right thing being rewarded, and they flat out refused to change their ridiculous rates.

First, at the end of each year -- and the beginning of the first quarter of the following year -- there is a seasonal downturn in our business. Second, this time there was also the additional challenge of the worsening economy. Just at the time when we needed our credit the most, Bank of America pulled the rug out from under us.    The prognosis for our company is very good. Our clients are the world's biggest in the field.

In turn, this means that our services are required, and new business thus also realized.    Consequently, ours are no ""long term"" issues. Just one of our contracts is worth many times the loan amount we are seeking.   The amount of this funding will help us fill the gap that Bank of America left for us.

Along with my own debt, it has been a bit overwhelming, but I  I have an excellent job, lots of motivation and determination.  I have ways to pay off debt, where she does not.  The 16000.00 would be used for this and only this.  I am not wanting anything other than just to manage things a bit easier and relieve some of the daily stress that I have.  I am a trustworthy person and would like someone to take a chance on me.  I know that my credit is not perfect, but my scores have been getting higher and I have been working hard for the past few years to make a difference on my credit report.  I have a request like many others, I am sure. My credit may come across to some as a high risk, but I can assure you that I am not.  I take my debts seriously and take responsibility for them. I have helped more than I should at times, but that is who I am.  I am confident in myself and want you to be as well.  Thank you for your consideration!<br/> Borrower added on 05/01/10 > This loan is very secure for the lender.  I have a very stable job and take pride in my work ethics.  I am simply trying to pay down my debt, increase my credit score, and manage my debts as simple as possible.  I am not a risk and have worked hard over the ast few years to really understand how to increase your credit and be considered a good candidate when applying for loans.  I would be thankful to the person or persons who fund my loan.  I am hoping to close this as soon as possible.  I want to change my current situation.  I would like one line vs. 6 or more.  I am making a difference not only for me but my faimly.  I would also be interested in doing future business with a lender that is willing to take a chance on me now.  I am true to my word and have many goals past the one I am trying to accomplish right now.  Again, thank you for your consideration. This is a whole new way to work with others to help each other- where both parties benefit.  I am hopeful that I will be a customer for many years to come.  Maybe someday for something a bit more exciting, but I am on my way!<br/> Borrower added on 05/02/10 > Here are the details of the debts I am looking to consolidate.  If I am fully funded I am going to get as many lines paid down as I can.  I usually pay more than the minimum and I would continue to do this on this one loan as well.   That would offset some of the higher interest being paid on some.  My overall payment would be lower and I would increase my credit score with the fewer number of lines and revolving credit.  I am not looking to continue to keep more than one cc. when pd off. I will close and pay off.  I believe I should let them report paid with a o balance and then start closing them.  I will seek advice on what it the best route.

With all this planned we expect to receive 10,000. dollars plus monthly in sales and hoping to make more than that with all of our outside resources. As of now several thousand of dollars have been used to purchase items that are stored and have already been sold on internet sales and some outside resources, thus that being said profits have been shown to be very profitable this loan will help with advertisements, tools, display cabinets, shelves, business sign, more inventory, website, as well several variables, as my company is starting and growing, I will be employed by my current employer for my solid source of income and with the help of my husband and family working with me in this venture i am sure that my company will be a great success.

After the initial advertising campaign, 5% of revenue will be used for advertising.<br/><br/>-Update the companyâs electronic equipment:  The electronic equipment the company uses can only be described as antiquated.  Paperwork that is currently presented to the prospective customer is hand written hard copy.  I will use 20% of investor supplied funds to purchase a field laptop, portable printer, and necessary software.  The impact on a prospective customer of a hand written proposal vs. a color, graphical electronic printout is well worth the cost.  <br/><br/>-Company Image:  I will use 20% of the investor supplied funds to update the company image.  The company does not have a website so a website will need to be developed and hosted.  Business cards, printed brochures, folders will need to be purchased also.  The company has no uniforms.  Uniforms for the crew and evaluator will give the company a more professional appearance.<br/><br/> The truck the company uses to haul the crew and heavy duty equipment is 14 years old.  It runs well but the appearance leaves much to be desired.  I will have the truck painted.  I will also have the company logo and contact information printed on the truck.

I was really not looking forward to my summer because although I have the time for the surgery and healing, I lacked the funds to see it through.  I asked the specialist in Toronto why insurance does not cover it, especially since there are no other options.  He told me that insurance will cover the equipment needed to perform the procedure, but not the surgery itself.  It is so frustrating to work so hard and ensure all monthly bills are covered, only to find out that all the insurance premiums I pay do absolutely nothing  to help me when I need it.  I also have narcolepsy and cataplexy which requires medication in order to maintain the level of seratonin necessary to get through my day.  The medications needed for this condition are very expensive and there are constant stressors from insurance there as well.  I am able to cover the meds that are not covered by the deductible/copay but I am just not able to prepared myself for something of this magnitude.  I think that this is a fantastic program for lending and someday when I am in a better place financially, I will gladly become a lender to someone who is in need like I am now.  I believe strongly in a ""pay it forward"" philosophy in all aspects, even it is just passing on a smile and/or ccompliment.

In the past few years the previous owner moved to Alabama and began to let the flower shop's operations become neglected and inconsistent. She recently closed the florist due to the complication of trying to operate the business from Alabama. <br/><br/>I plan to reopen the Florist shop in the same location because most of the larger equipment is still there, including a $10,000 walk-in cooler and display for the flowers. Having this equipment alone will make reopening the shop easier, and to add to that benefit my grandmother and her sister (who used to keep the books, and operated the business) have offered to work to get the business back to a profitable condition. They are confident that they will be able to earn back the business of all the major funeral homes in the area as well as the local courthouses and churches.<br/><br/>The Location that I have a pending contract on has little to no competition within about 10-15 miles in any direction. And is located on a high traffic volume state road, right next door to a Starbuck's coffee shop that has been very successful. <br/><br/>The landlord of the property has a good relationship with my family and has agreed to verbally commit the property to me until I am certain about the financing. He has also agreed to offer very generous concessions even though he has had two other possible florists show interest in the location.<br/><br/>Total operation costs including all expenses, labor and inventory averaged less than $5,000. My Grandmother and her sister informed me that on an average Valentine's Day week alone the store would generate over $10,000 in sales. They also assured me that one wedding would cover the expenses for an entire month, not including walk-ins and other sales.<br/><br/>I am a future CFA (Certified Financial Analyst), so I am very responsible with my financial condition and have a great financial and accounting background.

It has been a very difficult time, but I am deteremined to make it through. I appreciate any help that can be given.

I did not have the information in front of me to properly address it at the time, and as I have no internet service at home, I needed to call and get the details pertaing the remaining revolving credit balance. One lenders asked why I only requested $19,750.00 rather than the full amount of my debt. The answer for that question is: I was only allowed to request that amount, and according to the rules I read regarding a loan with Lending Club, a loan cannot exceed $25,000.00. I took the credit bills I have that had the highest percentage rates and added them up and that is how I determined the amount I did. The rates of these cards ranged from 18.99% to 23%. By consolidating and obatining a lower rate, I felt I would achieve 1.) a lower rate, which mean't less paid out in interest in the long run and less time to pay down money owed; 2.) would enable me to take high interest cards and combine them into one manageable payment; 3.) less hardship on my family. <br/><br/>The remaining revolving credit (totaling: $18,223.98) is care credit for $5,898.36; Barclay Mastercard for 4,435.88; Chase Visa $2,168.36; Chase $5,731.38; <br/><br/>I have stated the reasons for the debt, and I have covered, I think, the questions asked.

Many private vehicles- cars, mini-buses, motorcycles, bicycles etcâ¦ have been converted into taxis. The city of Kinshasa has a population of 9,000,000 people and there is a need to move 4,000,000 people on a daily basis. In Kinshasa the average load factor on large buses at the morning peak reaches 200 percent, with passengers hanging out of the bus or even sitting on the roof.<br/><br/>The urban transportation in the province of Kinshasa is mainly provided by two government owned corporations: City Train and STUC however, their fleet is limited. City Train has a total of 86 buses with a capacity to move 100,000 people. Due to its mismanagement, STUC active fleet has been reduced to 10 buses compared to 150 when it was first created in 2006. Both City Train and STUC are only able to move 120,000 people daily. According to a study by Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett, âStuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in Africaâ, the void in public transportation service is filled by private vehicles which account for 1200 minibuses. <br/><br/>The average family is able to afford no more than one daily round trip on the bus, while for the poorest households even this basic level of mobility is unattainable. But even this low rate of use translates into peak demand for around 200 seats per thousand residents, about five times higher than the supply available in any of the cities sampled.( Stuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in Africa, Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett)<br/><br/>To solve this problem, We have decided to enter this market by purchasing used school buses in the United States and used them for urban transportation in the city of Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo)<br/>I will be the General Manager in this business.<br/>",small_business,Urban Transportation,750xx,TX,8.04,0,5-Nov,1,,,7,0,14729,85.60%,8,18924.36,18905.44,2060.24,2802.32,61.45673653,14000.34,4902.08,10-Oct,801.27,19-Mar

I have been with my current job for the last 3 years and I am a shooting star in the company.  The one major item that is holding me back is the way my teeth are.  It is embarrassing to meet new people everyday with the set of teeth I have in mouth. There also is some dental work that needs to be fixed as I am in some pain.   I a also getting married 09/10/11 of next year and would like to look my best on my wedding day.  Do to poor parental guidance growing up these issues weren't taken care of then.  I am now 30 years old, making very decent money and I have no loans out there!  My monthly expenses are small as I have a roommate and we split a $900 rent payment - $450 for me.  I also own my car outright as I bought it used.  My monthly bills do not exceed $1,000.  I owe no money to any creditors and mystudent loans have all been paid.  <br/> My job is very stable, as cable and internet is one of the cheapest forms of entertainment and internet is a must in every home in america.  I also dj 3 nights a week for extra income ranging about an extra 3 grand a month.  Please consider helping me with this loan as this will help me for the rest of my life.

I make minimal extra money throughout the school year as a substitute in the afterschool program.  A low-ball figure of my yearly earnings is $52,732 (or $4394/mo.)  My fiance and I both have mortgages.  His child support and new car payment (to replace a car that no longer ran), have recently increased our monthly payments to a point where we have had to rely on credit cards for necessities so that we can put all of our income towards staying current on bill payments.  Therefore, I have an uncomfortable amount of debt right now which is making it difficult for me to qualify for the loan I need to rid myself of my mortgage payment (the only reasonable offer I have received on my house, which is an offer I would like to take to vastly lower our monthly payments, would require me to pay $17,000 at closing to cover the difference to my mortgage company and closing costs.)  I have wonderful credit other than my debt-to-income ratio because I am timely with my payments, and I just need a company to take into consideration that I will be relieving myself of $158,000 worth of debt if I qualify for this personal loan to allow me to sell my house.  I realize that a personal loan of this size would typically require collateral, such as the house which I am hoping to sell, but I hope that there can be some consideration in this matter also.  I am basically caught in a catch 22 because if I don't qualify for the personal loan and have to keep my house longer, my debt will continue to accrue thus making it even less likely that I will ever qualify for the loan due to my debt-to-income ratio; meanwhile, the housing market is continuing to dwindle, making it more likely that I will not get any better offers on my house.

I am looking to consolidate it all to improve my credit score to qualify for a business loan.  A good business loan requires a credit score of at least 720.  I am almost there.  I have a steady job and business that can give plenty of positive return.  I expect to pay off the LendingClub loan not in 3 years but in 6 months once I close 1 or 2 deals in my business or get that business loan.  My business involves real estate.  I will be purchasing distressed or bank owned properties and then reselling.  I already have a serious list of cash buyers and conventional financed buyers to resell to.  I have access to hard money lenders that will only lend to purchase property at wholesale price and resell at retail price where the difference is our profit.  If you want more details feel free to contact me.  The loan I am requesting right now is only a debt consolidation loan to improve my credit score and lower payments.  I have had no problem making payments just a problem getting a sufficient loan for my business or debt consolidation from a regular bank.  They are obviously not lending and want higher scores than what I have.

I have also used this card minimally for personal spending. I have never missed a payment on my card. The interest rate on the card is so high though and my balance is barely going down with each payment. This money would almost completely pay this card off and minimize the amount of money I have to pay each month, which would really really help me.  I am a student and work part time at a courrier service. I don't make too much money since its only part time and alot of my time is devoted to school, but like I said I've never failed to make my payment ontime and this would really save me alot of money. I will have the money every month to pay for sure. I have been working with this company for years now and it is run by a close family member so I will be sure to have my job.

I've always had automated payments with pretty much any company I ever dealt with.

Because I was used to automated, I had difficulty remembering to pay those manually, thereby ending up with those 3 ""more than 30 days late"" on my credit report.  I have since switched those over to automated, and have never had a problem since.  As you know, re-payment for this loan is automated, which guarantees you will be re-paid.

Working for the airlines schedule wise is a nightmare to accomplish ""normal"" business errands and every time they called I was flying during their normal business or bankers hours.

Positive credit and payment history should be rewarded with reasonable terms...  I have outstanding credit and a payment history of no delinquencies or late payments in my 20 year credit history, I also tend to pay off my loans early/quickly as I enjoy a ""free-state of mind"".   I have presently saved enough money to pay off one of my credit cards (Discover), however would prefer to pay off instead the one with highest rates that is 27.99% and that is still the best (AMEX) offers for my excellent credit score and payment history.   With regards to resolving AMEX - I believe there is a better way and a lower interest rate so I can pay in a more rapid manner, and not with more going to interest than principal. The best way to achieve this is to pay it off completely by consolidating the debt into a loan with more fair interest rate terms which will allow me to pay it far more quickly.  I am asking for funds to accomplish this as both I and my wife have a clear goal in mind - purchase a home in the future and finally start a family. Due to my wife's recent pregnancy loss eariler this year, we feel that destiny rewarded our angel baby back up to heaven to give us more time to refocus and better plan ahead for our future and that of our family. As such before we try again, we want no debt and finally our very own home. As we are now very focused on paying down my debt (as we just paid off the last of hers) we feel this will finally position us to have the home and family in the near future, hopefully in a time frame of the next 2-3 years completing our dreams.

My goal is to eliminate my revolving debt so that my wife and I can then obtain a mortgage. More traditional financing options have shown no success, as we face a frustrating and ironic problem: We have too much revolving debt to obtain a loan to consolidate our revolving debt. As we are not home owners, we have no equity available to us.  We have a consistent and dependable payment history for much longer than the 2 years highlighted here. We have *NO DELINQUENCIES* during our 6 year history together. We each also have stable work histories, which is detailed below.  After looking at several other listings on this site, I wanted to preempt many questions that you may have, and have provided a summary of income and expenses. Once our revolving accounts are paid off, the majority of them will be closed. I know this may ding our credit score a bit, but we feel that we no longer need access to these lines of credit, and do not want to be tempted to put ourselves back into debt. I want each of you to be confident in your decision to fund this loan request, as it would provide my family the opportunity to take a big step towards realizing our dreams of home-ownership. I would to like to offer in advance my sincerest gratitude to each and every one of you that decides to contribute to my loan, and assure you that my family and I are a solid addition to your portfolio.

I am obtaining this loan because I have accrued some revolving debt the past several months which I will explain throughout this posting.  I would much rather pay interest to people rather than to the credit card companies so that is why I am using lending club.     I bought a brand new home some time ago and it became time to do the backyard.  The yard is huge and took a lot of time and money to complete but it is now done.  I am also getting married very soon so we not only had to pay for the backyard but we also had to pay for the remainder of our wedding.  Needless to say, our expenses have been very high these past few months but everything is now paid for and it is business as usual now and time to pay off the debt.     With this loan, I am going to pay off my revolving credit card debt and a loan I already have with Lending Club.  I obtained a loan in January of this year with Lending Club in the amount of $16,000 with a monthly payment of $530.  I have paid that loan down to a balance of $6990 in 9 months so I have averaged paying over $1,000 a month each month on that loan.  You may ask why I haven't been paying the minimum on the Lending Club loan and using the cash I would save by not paying extra on Lending Club to pay for my expenses on the backyard and wedding.  The answer is that the two main credit cards that I have been using have the introduction rate of 3% but that goes away in November so it made sense to do what I have been doing.     The lending club loan I referenced above I obtained due to a vehicle.  Unfortunately, I made a couple poor choices in college in changing vehicles and kept on rolling negative equity into cars that I purchased.  When I worked for my company prior to this, I bought a new Dodge vehicle and rolled in quite a bit of negative equity.  With my prior company, they did not provide me with a company car so I had to use my own vehicle.  I put 30,000 miles on the vehicle in one year and then I left that company to come to my current company and they provide me with a company vehicle.  I had to sell my Dodge with a ton of miles in a awful economy with a lot of negative equity in it to start with.  I had to get rid of it way below blue book and took a huge loss.  Live and learn.     I am a Marketing Representative with a Insurance Company with a base salary of $77,500.  In addition to the salary, I receive monthly commissions based on performance and year to date through Septempber I have made $79,000 so far and I project to make $107,000 for the year at least.  I have been with this company for a year and a half and have complete job security.  I have a company car so I have no car payment, no insurance, no maintenance, and no fuel expenses.  Also, I work from home so my company pays for my cell phone, home phone, and cable internet.  With all of those things, that adds up to be a lot of money that I save each month for expenses.  I also have a side job with a friend that I make $150/month in as well.     Income:   $9000/month salary   Expenses:   Lending Club:  From my calculations, it will be $640/month or so with this loan amount. Student Loan:  $150 Mortgage:  $2250 (split 2 ways with my fiancee) Utilities/Food/Entertainment:  Varies, but $500 is probably about average   As you can see, my income is great versus my expenses.  I have no late or missed payments on my credit report and never will.  My credit score is lower than usual just because I have the revolving debt on it right now and that impacts the score.  Before this debt was on the reports a few months ago, my credit scores were all around 720.    Thank you very much for reading this very long posting and considering this loan.

We're a happily married couple (17 years) with children, and we're seeking a loan to eliminate our credit card debt. For years, we've consistently paid more than minimum payments and paid on time.   Recently an incident that resulted from the Chase taking over of WaMu has made us wary of credit cards in general.  We were told that we had agreed to accepting statements via email (something we do not recall agreeing to). However, their first email statement was sent to an old email address. When we discovered the error and realized our payment was late, we immediately paid. However, Chase DOUBLED our interest rate as a result of this one late payment!    I'm sure you can understand our frustration with Chase since we were always a good, long-time customer of WaMu with no history of delinquencies.   HSBC is another company that has raised interest rates recently with no apparent reason. We were simply notified they were raising rates, and there was nothing we could do about it.   We are asking for a loan to pay off all our credit card debt and get out from under these ridiculous interest rates. We've always paid more than minimum payments, but with rates this high, it's virtually impossible to pay them off.   We run a successful marketing business with lots of high-paying jobs on the books. And since we specialize in marketing, we are experts in creating new business for ourselves ""on-demand"" (recently we ran a promotion for $300 and generated $8000 in sales in 10 days).   Many of these credit card purchases were from marketing and investments in building our business, at the time of these rate increases we were working hard to pay off these debts. We have no doubt that we will easily be able to pay off this loan and give you a good, safe return on your investment.

I have a B.S. in Engineering and have been working within my degree since I graduated college in May 2005. I am successful in what I do and have been a salaried employed by the same company (minus a 5 month hiatus where I quit to work for another company) since I graduated. As a note, my company was more than willing to take me back, thank goodness.   My situation is probably not unique from many other people's however one thing that is unique about me is that I respect and fulfill every debt that I have incurred. I have never had negative comments on my credit report and do whatever it takes to fulfill my obligations including taking second jobs and working as much as 100 hours a week or more.   So you are probably wondering how I got to the point where I am writing this asking for a loan to pay off credit cards. When I married my wife she had a 2 year old son. At that point I had two years of college left. Within these two years, my stepson's father dragged us into court 4 times. Since college he has dragged us into court 2 more times. Attorney's fees stacked up fast and during college we had no other option. Either pay cash and be forced to live on credit or visa versa. Needless to say by the time I graduated and started my career we were already way behind the financial 8-ball and have not been able to recuperate.    I feel probably like most, that there is no way out and no light at the end of the tunnel. I will not try a counseling scam and until now I had no knowledge of peer-to-per lending. I think the concept is brilliant. Why not help others that are willing to help you. Its a win win situation.   I don't feel I have been irresponsible with my credit. I don't have ""toys"", expensive electronics (I salvaged our TV from my neighbors trash), or even go on vacation. Regardless, its to the point now where I need to see a light at the end of the tunnel. If I can see a date on a calendar where I know the debt will be gone that would be a great relief to me and my marriage.  When I was growing up, the one thing I swore to myself was that I was going to be financially stable for my kids. I wanted them to grow up without worrying about money as I did. Not that my kids are old enough to worry about that now but if this continues I know I will fail.

I currently run a gym that offers boxing, mixed martial arts, and personal training. Presently the gym is located in an industrial park, and is inconvenient to our 131 members, due to the lack of parking. The goal of the gym is to grow and be a more accessible location.     There is a need for more equipment to accommodate the members. The current location is approximately 3,000 square feet, while the new location is roughly 5,000 square feet. At times members are forced to exercise close together.  Extra space will allow the addition of new equipment and there will be ample room for the members to work out. With the growth of membership space in the facility is scarce.     The current location of the gym is simply a loading bay. There is no air ventilation, and the gym gets rather hot and humid.  The new location will be beneficial because it has a ventilation system that would create a better comfort level to the members of the gym. Without proper ventilation we run the risk of people having heat related illnesses.     Overall the move to this new facility I will be able to better manage the everyday operations of the gym while providing a more comfortable environment for the members to work out.

With the drought in financing to acquire homes I have lately been buying mobile homes located in mobile home parks with cash and renting them out.  I buy the mobiles with my cash and rehab them. Once the home is completed and filled with a tenant or tenant/buyer I obtain a private lending loan to recover my cost and to move on to the next project.  This loan would cover my acquisition and rehab cost for the property. The tenant pays a weekly rent of $120 a week. The lot rent is $170 a month. This property cash flows approximately $350 a month averaged out over the course of a year leaving plenty of room for a loan of $5000.  My Experience:  I have acquired over 50 properties in the past 3 years and run a property management company that manages over 150 units in the Northwest Georgia area.  I have raised over $500,000 in private money for acquiring single family homes over the past 3 years and continue to do so. I can provide documentation of security deeds for mortgages from my private lenders and the cancellations showing that the loans were paid off.  I have two full time contractors that work for me and rehab the properties that we acquire and we quickly fill most all of our units.

I would very much rather owe one institution/lender than several.  This way I could also save on my car insurance, by not having to have full-coverage.    Also, I do get paid cash but this has not affected my credit score since I have paid on time, not going to say always because there were two instances where I paid late, but not later than 15 days past the due date, and this was over a year.    I'm responsible and in no manner will I misuse the money.  I'm a college graduate, hence why I'm in debt, I used my credit cards for tuition, books, gas, meals, and supplies.  I don't want to damage my credit, so debt consolidation is out of the question, so is bankruptcy.  I don't believe in the easy way out, regardless the situation I made a conscious choice to use my credit cards even though it was for college.

I also wish to increase my direct marketing through brochure and other mailings and e-marketing methods.

The two principals both have excellent credit rating. I can also provide you with both FICA scores.  This small amount we are seeking will help us at a time when our company needs this ""bridge"". We can either pay it off incrementally, or in full upon the occasion of our next contract. Our last contract was worth $84,000, and the one we are now in the process of securing will be at least that much. This is one of four permanent clients, plus others as we make the sale.

This loan will provide me the opportunity to further my education, consolidate some of my indebtedness and advance my career and income.   I'm extremely excited about my decision to accomplish my long awaited dream of obtaining my Masters degree in Psychology and Counseling.  Although I joyfully taught in the public school system for 23 years, my desire was always to be of greater service.  Most recently, I have practiced as a licensed Real Estate Associate Broker in Colorado.   Suddenly I have found myself divorced, financially challenged and responsible to a large degree for the care nurturing and well-being of my beloved 9 year old granddaughter.  Being of sound mind and spirit, I'm well aware that NOW is the time to take action, move forward in positive directions and create a bright future for myself and my little one.   As my teaching license expired in 2005, My immediate goal is to begin my Masters Program and reinstate my teaching license after completion of my first 6 semester hours, which will enable me to substitute teach while continuing my education.  As the opportunity arises I will also sell homes and vacant land to supplement my income while attending school.  Realizing that my requested loan amount may fall a bit short of financing my entire Masters, I am confident that I will be able to secure scholarships or grants to complete my degree program.  I hope to graduate within 18 months of enrolling.   Upon completion of my degree, my intent is to be employed as a school counselor within the public school system or practice family counseling with a private counseling service provider, thus increasing my income and ability to repay this essential loan.   In the long-term, my fondest wish is to establish a very special ranch, in my mountain home area, which will provide unique opportunities for handicapped children and adults alike, as well as services, facilities and respites for families in need.

BUSINESS BACKGROUND  The current owner works full-time as a professional in another industry and is overwhelmed by the business. She'd rather focus on her career than run a business, and is willing to accept $99K for it, but is requiring a significant portion down. We will be putting $50K down, and pay off the remainder within 6 months.   If we end up not acquiring the business because of insufficient capital, and yet this loan is approved, it will immediately be paid back.  The business is a truck (mobile clinic) with a hydrostatic body composition dunk tank. The owners of these clinics visit gyms/fitness clubs and run body fat tests all day long, parked out front. Clubs are very eager to have the clinics there. We can hype their personal training services, draw in potential members people from the area, and we can offer a small revenue share.   BUSINESS' FINANCIALS  Tests are $45, with discounts for repeat customers. Accounting for repeats, the average price per test is $35. Most clinics operate part-time for a modest 6 hours (by choice), yielding them between 20 - 30 tests/day (5 - 6 tests/hour). Trucks in less populous areas have cash flows of $20K - $25/monthly.  Note that 20 - 30/day is an average of _all territories_, such as St. Louis, Milwaukee, etc. The populations of these areas are _far_ thinner in comparison to the region we will be taking over, which is everything south of LA. Only one clinic has the rights to a greater population--Northern California-- which performs very well, with tests in the 30 - 40 tests/day range, operating less than 8 hours/day. We will be operating for more hours to support the great demand in our region: 12 - 16, instead of merely 6 or 8. The only days the clinic will not be in operation are the major holidays (e.g. Thanksgiving, Christmas).  Monthly operating costs are very low: $2,000 - $3,000, plus hourly staffing.  CASH FLOW  Based on the data from existing clinics, we've projected two estimates of cash flow. With operating expenses so low, we could do half our projections and _still_ be profitable.  Conservative:  	$35/test x 35 tests/day x 30 days = $37K/month.  Projected:  	$35/test x 45 tests/day x 30 days = $47K/month.  MY BACKGROUND/FINANCES  I've been employed at a technology company that sells data to Fortune 500 companies since graduating with a BA in Business Management of IS in 2006. My role is Lead Developer (programmer) of the software development team. Yearly income is $55K, and I have unexercised stock options whose shares constitute 1.4% of the company. 	  Money in/month:   	$4,583.33 gross  Money out/month:  	* Rent: $400 	* Student loans: $275 	* Food: $400 	* Cell and utilities: $200 	* Credit card payments: $75 	* No vehicle expenses; public transportation at $70 	* Medical: $30 	* Misc.: $250 	Total: $1,700 +/- 100  MY BUSINESS PARTNER  My partner is the owner of a Cold Stone Creamery (gourmet ice cream), which he paid for in cash.

Rather than just replacing the head with the stock engine internals, I plan on purchasing a fully custom built motor which will cost approximatley $5,000 to $6,500 depending on the options.  This will also help increase the value of the car and provide more longevity.  The car is so rare that since I purchased it in 2005, it's value has only depreciated $2000.  I am willing to use it as collateral if necessary.  Also, on my credit report there is one delinquent account for like $120, which I am in the process of trying to resolve right now.

The latest version of VinyasaMT was released in January of 2008 and already has a small customer base – about 50 paid subscriptions to date.    And now, as of Friday, April 4, 2008, we received a signed letter of intent from Ford Motor Company to provide VinyasaMT and the data management services behind it, to over 100 of Ford’s approved accessory suppliers. This agreement with Ford requires each supplier to purchase a minimum of one subscription of VinyasaMT. Our conservative goal is to sign up half of this supplier base by December 31, 2008. This equals $100,000 of revenue.  The money we are requesting will help support this increase in customer base. It requires the immediate hiring of one or two data management employees and the upgrading of our hardware infrastructure.   Additional information about ADR International, Inc.

We now are a fairly successful restaurant, but personally we need this loan because it is affecting my entire families ability to pay our bills.  We will use this loan to pay off all of the high interest credit card bills so we can concentrate more on making money and building the company.  We could definatley use your help.  Thank you.    My financial situation: (explain why you are a good candidate for paying back this loan) I feel that I am a good candidate of paying back this loan because I have experience, integrity, and the innovation in not only helping repay my investors but most importantly putting the food on the table for my family.  My wife and kids are my life and without them I would be nothing.  I have not been late on a loan or missed a payment for 7 years since I first entered college!  Combined with my 8 years in the services industry and being a top rated business man throughout my years, I feel that I am a great candidate for this loan.  I really need to help pay off these debts and especially for the ones that I love, and with the power of that love, and YOUR HELP, we will enable the opportunity save money, pay off our debts, and setup a plan to place my children through college.

A women's clothing boutique is being sold close to where we live.  This is a great location as it is across the street from a middle school and sandwiched between a brand new neighborhood and a developing neighborhood.  It is being sold because the seller has 2 other businesses and is unable to grow & manage this boutique to achieve profitability quicker.  Though there will be seller financing, a down payment is expected and we will need some extra money to act as a buffer for intangibles.  The Good: We tend to quickly increase profitability by lowering some of the overhead costs.  We intend to sell retail as well as act as a broker for those looking to make high end specialty purchases.  We will develop the website so that it will serve as a social networking site that will allow us to take input from shoppers who are looking for unique fashions.  Items will be sold on the site, and overstock items will be directed to overseas markets.  We intend to keep inventories fairly low.  My income is sufficient to cover extra problems that may arise.  My wife is not working and will manage & grow the business full time.  The Bad: This is retail and it may not be profitable for at least 6 months (thats not your problem though....).  The customer base is undeveloped and we will need to do a significant amount of marketing to build it.  This should not be too big a problem though as my wife is a recent MBA grad.  The Ugly: I'm in grad school and my loans will come calling by the end of summer in 08.  Since my last personal loan I have not defaulted or been late with any payments, but I have gotten more credit cards and have increased my available balances on all of them very recently; this may be a why it has gone down.  Also, I've gone from W2 employee to 1099 contractor (no taxes hoooray!), the uncertainty of self employment may have altered the grade as well.

I'm a recently engaged, hardworking professional in my mid-20's who is trying to start a new life with my partner, but several roadblocks have come up along the way.  I have always been a very honest, do-it-myself kind of person. Growing up in a lower middle class family, I worked and supported myself all throughout high school and college.   I currently work as a program director at a nonprofit organization that provides clinical, legal, and shelter services to domestic violence victims. It is a salaried position with full benefits (but the salary is at a typical nonprofit level). My partner is an artist/illustrator. We both work very hard and do not have a lavish lifestyle at all. We've tried to be frugal and save, but my partner recently had some legal, automobile, and medical costs to pay for which wiped out our savings.  My partner has sold the car, I have taken on a freelance job in addition to my full-time job, and now we are looking to move to a cheaper apartment as well as eventually get married. A loan of $10,000 would allow us to pay the last month's rent on the current apartment, pay for the security/first/last on a new, more affordable apartment, pay for moving expenses (we do not have much furniture or possessions), pay off my partner's legal and medical expenses, and maybe set aside some for our new life together.  I'm not proud to be requesting money from strangers because I've always tried to work my way through life and figure things out, but the situation has just become so tough and desperate with the fact I need to support my partner, and I would do anything for us to have a life together. Moving to a cheaper apartment and paying off the unexpected legal, automobile, and medical expenses will allow us to better manage our income and get back on our feet, and our top priority would be paying back this loan.  Also, I'm not quite sure how this process works as I've never done it before, but we currently live in New York but I was originally based in New Jersey, so that is why my location indicates New Jersey (we may also end up moving to New Jersey due to the more affordable rent).

I am currently getting larger projects than I have in the past, and I will need to get another person to help me finish them. Once these projects are done, this investment should pay for itself.  2) I want to establish a lending history with installment loans so that in the future, banks will be able to lend me greater amounts than I am asking for now.  Over the past five years, I have always paid my credit cards on time and that earned me ... well, a score of 729 on Experian, (766 and 768 on TransUnion and Equifax), so I guess you can see I'm a pretty low risk.

I'd be happy to answer any other questions.<br/> Borrower added on 10/04/10 > I would like to clarify that although it shows that I was delinquent on a payment 2 years ago, this is an error. When the Credit management company took over, I was told to make my regular payments up to a specific date where they would take over. They told me they communicated with all my creditors but apparently they were late in dispersing payment to one creditor. I was up to date with my payments to my creditors and to the credit management program, but it looks as if I missed a payment when in fact I was on time with all my payments. I've tried to dispute this several times, and I've been unsuccessful in removing this false delinquent hit to my credit report. I don't know what else to do about it.<br/><br/>Please rest assured that I make all my payments on time to all my creditors. I also pay all my utilities, cable, internet and cell phone on time as well. According to my Experian Report (which I get twice a month) my score with them is at 719, and I have a consistent on time payment history. <br/><br/>Thank you again to everyone who is funding my loan. I'm very appreciative.<br/> Borrower added on 10/04/10 > I would also like to add that I was a full time student at the time that I applied for and utilized these credit cards. I was dependent on them at the time but the interest rates were high and I could not keep up with the payments because I was in college. <br/><br/>I put them on the credit management program because I didn't want to be late and ruin my credit and I wanted the interest rates to drop. Although the program was helpful, and the interest rates are quite low, it is hindering my ability to move forward. I want to clean my credit profile and elevate it.  I also feel that having this new loan from Lending Club (as opposed to 4 credit cards with low interest on a credit management plan) will be a good and smart way to improve my score over the long run as I make consistent monthly payments.<br/> Borrower added on 10/06/10 > I really am looking forward to having this loan fully funded.

He was then sent to CCU to be examined for a pacemaker defect.   I was shaking.  I called my mother and she cheered me on.  His wife hugged me and it was so wonderful that I could give him back to her.  That's why I would never leave my job that feeling and of course it is a steady income and security, for me to be a good risk to pay back my bills.  I do make a good living it was just the leave that put me behind I only got a small % of my normal income @ this time. And you may think because I am a medical employee there would be no medical or medicine bills but unfortunately this is not true at all.  I am so glad to be back at work though so I can get my steady income of approx. 2000$ a month, more if I can do overtime.

I am a 28 y/o professional that helps Drs. at a world Famous hospital in Minnesota get funding for research to help patients.  I love having the opportunity to make the lives of cancer patients better, and help develop new techniques for radiation oncology.  It is incredibly stressful, but also reqarding.  <br/>Life hit a speed bump when I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety earlier this year, and then got worse when my wife decided that she was going to divorce me.  Because of the divorce my wife has kind of taken control, and I pretty much only see my adorable 15 month old daughter every other Saturday.  (I'm tearing up just thinking about it.)  My plan with this money is to assist me with divorce attorney fees because my family has never had money like her family has.  I also want to purchase a cruiser motorcycle that I can use for the occasional trips to visit my daughter where my soon to be ex leaves the house and I spend time with my little girl there.  I think this will really save on gas money.  Also, I just think that riding on the open road (helmet for me of course), would be a great stress reliever.  I really just need to feel less stress..., feel happy, and feel normal again.<br/><br/>Thank you for all of you that look at this and help.  I could really use this for so many reasons right now.  I hope it will happen.  <br/><br/>Thank you all in advance.  You have no idea how much it means to me.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Seth B.<br/> Borrower added on 07/20/10 > Thank everyone so much.  If  I am fortunate enough to obtain this loan, it will be used for a bike.

I hope this is able to come through soon.<br/><br/>Best Regards.<br/> Borrower added on 07/20/10 > Thank you all so much.  I am just finishing going through a divorce, and this will help with medical bills I was left with so that they can be paid and the hospital won't try to be collecting from me.  Also, I was left with a higher interest card with a balance and this would help take care of that.  Also, I have been through a great deal since before last November (depression, illness, injury, divorce...and now I am only currently able to see my 15 month old daughter every other Saturday, and that's usually not even spending the night...) I have always wanted a bike (non-sports/rocket) in order to get some open air (helmet of course), and just try to be a little bit happier since it has been so long since I have.  I appreciate all of your help.  Thank you, and best regards.<br/> Borrower added on 07/21/10 > Thank you everyone that has helped so far.  I really appreciate it.  I just wanted to let it be known that I will have additional medical expenses for myself that would also need to be covered by this.

(It is more important for me to get bills taken care of than to purchase a bike as a post divorce stress-reliever, even though I think it would have assisted me with some other issues I am currently dealing with.

Due to the current financial economy, I was not able to obtain a student loan.   I usually obtain my student loans through TERI, which is currently in reorganization and is not accepting new loans.   I go to law school part time in the evening (don't hold this against me for those of you who may not be fond of lawyers) and work full time as a senior business analyst.     I will be consolidating the personal loan, as well as some credit card debt.  The payment of this loan ($378) will be lower than what I am currently paying for these debts ($294 for the loan, $75/month for two different credit cards that I plan to pay off).   In addition, the interest rate on this loan is lower than all rates on these three items.   Thank-you for your consideration - again, I have no late payments or any other negative credit history.

Status:Charged Off,"I will be using this money to pay a set-up fee deposit for a franchise opportunity. The fee is reimbursed at my first closing and at that time I will be repaying my loan (expected to occur in 90 days). This money will cover all marketing, training, business cards, a website set up and all advertising that is professionally done by the company.   I have a full time job as a business finance consultant. This occupation has lent itself to my ability to start my company - having over 15 years experience in this industry. My franchise business will be both real estate investment and finance consulting. In the finance consulting part I assist small to medium sized business owners obtain funding by partnering with an established commercial business finance company that has in-house underwriting and the ability to fund deals directly or use a connected lending source. These deals have a minimum average amount of $1.5M with a 1.5% fee per loan which is split with the franchise. In the real estate investment part I acquire and renovate income producing properties.  These properties are purchased at a low entry value (under appraised value) - usually no more than 65% acquisition. These properties are then stabilized and provide affordable housing, often with the  option of government subsidized rentals which is guaranteed rental income.   I am a good financial risk for this loan because my business dealings provide my business with high cash returns on low entry business opportunities. I am highly experienced in lead generation of qualified business owners in need of financing as my W-2 job is as a commercial lead pre-qualifier/originator for an out-of-state commercial lender. Over the past year I have averaged on a monthly basis leads totaling refinance amounts in excess of $5M (with a 70% closing ratio). I also budget well and keep my expenses low (as seen in my A credit grade). Please let me know if you have any questions and thank you for looking at my listing.

I know that closing the CC accounts may hurt my FICO a little in the short run, but I want to close them nevertheless.  Purpose of loan: Payoff highest-rate credit card debt, which is currently 28-31.5%.  Getting another loan with a lower interest rate will improve my monthly cashflow.  My progress:  Today I have 14 credit lines with a revolving credit balance of 150K and utilization of 99% (result of recently paying down 2 CC accounts anc closing them).   My financial situation:  I have accumulated too much credit card debt and continue to work to pay it all off.  I have a perfect payback history: no missed payments or delinquent accounts.  My payback history in my credit files is perfect, but I have let some credit card rates get too high by some inattention on my part.  I opened some credit cards with low introductory rates on balance transfers but because I was late on a couple of the payments by literally 1-3 days, the credit card companies jacked up the rates.  Those initial low interest rate offers (e.g., 0 to 3.99% for 12 months) for balance transfers were tempting, but came back to haunt me.  My credit rating/score looks poor becasue of my high percent of borrowing vs. limit.  I've always paid back and will continue to.  I have no delinquencies or negatives on my credit reports and I'm committed to it staying that way.  Any form of negative mark on my credit report is not an option for me.  If my loan is funded, I will immediately pay down my highest interest debt .

The established (6 year of successful growth) parent corporation is financially sound, has wonderful people who are experienced and successful leaders.  Furthermore, the territory I have negotiated to purchase is a perfect fit with over 60,000 of our target households.  Our business is going to experience explosive growth immediately, as the area is growing faster than the schools can build.  It is a perfect time for us to step in with a proven system that provides a service that is in high demand and short supply--right now. Please help us get started as soon as possible, so this opportunity doesn’t go to someone with cash in hand.

Status:Charged Off,"About me: I'm a young, ambitious, and excited student, father and future husband. The most important things in the world to me are my fiancee and her daughter, whose second birthday party I just had the pleasure of attending last month. I have a good job that I enjoy. I love to travel, speak foreign languages, and play the piano, and I'm a proud math/computer geek.  Purpose of loan: I'm finishing school! Since graduating high school in 03, I was a full-time student for two years, a half-time student in Germany for one semester, and part-time or no-time for the rest. Part of the reason is financial, part of it is personal, but all of it is behind me and I'm ready to commit to a non-stop trip to Diploma Town.  And I want you to come with me! I don't want this to be an impersonal ""you give me money, I say thanks and make payments"" kind of thing. I want you to get to know me, and see what your money is doing! Through a blog I promise to update regularly, you'll get to see the positive impact you're having on me and my family, and I'll also be happy to share news of my academic performance so you can see you're not throwing the money away on some loser. Maybe we could even turn this from just an investment into a friendship. By funding this loan, you are saving me from working 80 hours a week, giving me time to focus equally on my job and education, with plenty left over for my family.  I have just been accepted as a transfer student to the University of Illinois at Springfield, to pursue a B.A. in Mathematical Sciences. I will need 49 credit hours to finish. By my calculation, the total cost will be approximately $12,500 including books and fees, of which I am seeking 30% with this loan. I will be beginning in June with a scheduled completion in May 2010.  My goal is to break into the actuarial profession. If you're unfamiliar with it, actuaries are basically paid very well (often six figures) to predict the future--that is, calculate risk, particularly associated with insurance. It's a very important, but reportedly very low-stress profession. The latter is critical to me, because I want to spend as much time as possible with my family.  My financial situation: My fiancee and I both work full-time. I have a well-paying job as an entry-level manager for a construction company, and she's a barista (caffeine dealer).

Status:Charged Off,"I am a 34 year old full time Realtor of 9 years in Northern Virginia. My wife Karen just returned to her full time teaching position within our public schools of 13 years. She was in a shared position for the last 4 years so she could be home with our 3 kids (that are all under 5) and the days she worked I kept the kids. In that time she finished her Phd, reared 3 kids for 18 months each, now is obtaining her administration certificate & national board certification. I am fortunate enough to work from home plus I have 2 local offices. We need a loan to offset costs from not only education but the very expensive preschool. We have good credit (I was 729 just last week) and typically good income. Never had major defaults, never anything major at all. With me being self employed it is tougher to get a loan even though I have had my business for 9 years, 6 of which with the same firm. My wife just returned (in Sept) to full time work, we had several years of intented reduced income but we made good investments and am able to live comfortably. That time at home was priceless and worth every penny and sacrifice! We have retirement, mutual funds, college savings plans for the 3 kids, substantial life insurance (perm & term) but we don;t want to touch them. We have supportive families however elect not to go that route. We own lots of real estate. All have equity available. The 2nd biggest reason for this loan is to replinish what we spent to SAVE one of our properties. My wife inherited a farm house that has been in the family for 5 generations. In order to get the deed we agreed never to sell the property (must go to our kids) and we will not use the property for collateral or borrow against it. It was broken into and then abandoned 20+ years ago after Karen's grandmothers death. It was in disrepair. Karen's mom has been battleing cancer for quite a while. Both her parents are aging so we decided to RESCUE the house & outbuildings, fix them up, and hold a surprise Christmas dinner there for her family. We did it! Now we have a nice farmette on 6 acres that we own free and clear - no leins - and are using it. It's value is $300,000+. We also own 2 resort waterfront properties that have substantial equity in them however because they are worth 1.2 million, combined, 2 props deeded as 1, it is hard to obtain a loan using typical mortgages due to secondary market conditions and requirments. That property is planned to be vacation & special event rentals this year but until then it is a second home. We have little unsecured debt. Several credit cards have zero or low balances but 2 are higher and need to be consolidated. Our family Volvo is owned free and clear, my truck only has 18 months left to pay on it, and we have a Nissan Van lease that is up in 4 months. We own 5 boats, 4 of which are owned free and clear. 1 has a balance of about 7k. We have a newer HELOC for 88k used for the fix up that if someone is interested we would like to re-do so we can sell the other property that it is attached to. For now we can really use this 25k to consolidate existing debts, get my wife through these last few professional certifications, and allow me to finish my West VA realtor's license (weeks away) to expand my business. What is left I plan to pamper my wife with a small trip and mini makeover! After years of growing it, she wishes to donate her hair to locks of love. I think she has enough for 1 1/2 childrens wigs. Please help! I read about this program and it sounded perfect for our needs. This is simply brilliant! Plus we intend to do the same for other people as soon as preschool is done!

Status:Charged Off,"Welcome and thank you for your inquiry,  My Name is Juan and a year ago my uncle (a contractor) was having a slump with out any business he asked me if i knew anything about the internet and how to get leads. We started looking a ServiceMagic.com and found it to be way to expensive and the leads where given not just to him but every contractor in the area. So by the time he called around the customer was just aggravated from to many calls. I took upon a task to built him a simple website that would get him the leads, but we notice this was not making any progress so i started to research how internet works and found google, yahoo and msn have great marketing and advertising tools that help out small business but although it was effective we found it to be expensive. I then realized a term called SEO/SEM (Search Engine Optimization/Search Engine Marketing) six months later after a few classes and plenty of research and books i was able get him top rankings for contractors in his area of business, best of all the website was getting natural ads in google, yahoo and msn top ten ads on those three search engines is tuff you not only need to be established but you have to be loud on the internet!! So we did it and he started getting his first 1-3calls a day then we turned to 5-10 and now we get roughly 7-15 calls but my avg is 7 calls during winter season when trees, fences and roofs have plenty of accidents and problems. We have yet to experience a summer but i could only imagine. My uncle and i agreed $10.00 a call was fair weather or not the job got done. He then referred a friend of his with a Janitorial Company and the model works for his business as well, so i decide to offer this great tool to other small business in the area. A bit hesitant to the new idea a lot of business turned me down but that didn't stop my persistence, so i offered the service Free for the first month. Yes I told them i would help your business succeed as long as you give me the chance to show you what i could do. After adding 4 more clients i found myself, not only creating and maintaining the websites but also doing the marking  on a daily basis for all 6 clients this included taking the initial call, tracking the calls, invoicing my clients, and lots of other business administration stuff that took a regular 12-15hr days after six months i noticed my health and wife were really getting sick of a workaholic so, I recently started looking for software that would do most of the marketing for me and i also found a outsourcing company that would take the calls, track the calls and best yet invoice my clients. I also need to higher a accountant, My focus will be in getting more clients and i found that to be easy with my 30 day free trial period with no risk to a small business.

My living expenses are well below my total income and my investment in this business venture will only go to strengthen my financial position.  I have never been late on one payment in 10 years since I first established my credit. The financial risk of this investment is limited to my investment of $25,000 and the rest of the financing is in place from the other partners so that the certainty that the project will reach completion is already assured. The  return on investment is projected to be 9% in the first year after my debt serrvice but jumps to 12%-15%  in the second and third years. Since this is a long term investment the negative return for the first few years is justified as it will be positive once the loan is repaid.  Also,  t he probability of additonal sites opening and  being funded by the existing  operations will increase the future returns and more than be worth the tax deductible interest for this loan that I am asking you to fund.

Status:Charged Off,"Reason for Loan: I will be using this loan to hire a personal assistant to help with my daily living needs. During the past two years since the Great Hurricane Rita Evacuation in Houston, Texas. I developed a pressure wound on my right buttock, shortly after the evacuation. Pressure wounds grow from the inside outwards. With my Spina Bifida Disability I'm confined to a wheelchair. I am fully independent but at 35 years old its time to ask for an assistants help. I do not have full sensation in this area of the wound. A normal drive to Dallas from Houston is 4 hours, during this evacuation it took me 29 hours. During driving long distances in vehicles its difficult to perform needed very often pressure lifts/reliefs. I had this pressure wound operated on Sept. 12, 2006 after staying flat on my back one month in the hospital I went home two weeks later it opened up again. I also had Osteomyelitis & MRSA it was treated with PICC Line IV antibiotics for the duration of those six weeks. Nov. 13, 2007 I'm back in the hospital again I had 2 (Nov.13th&16th) procedures of debridement the bone of infection. No MRSA was located this time thank God. I am once again on a PICC line for the next 2 weeks while I'm recovering from a 3rd (Nov. 21st) procedure muscle flap this wound is closed. (Dec.17) I had a 4th procedure to close an abscess. This started the healing process back from scratch. Two more weeks from today I can try sitting. I had this same procedure in 1992; in total I have had 47 surgeries. My business is my escape from all the procedures. With this loan it would give me the cushion I need to work at a pace until I'm 100% healed again. My financial situation: I have two major RACING clients one of them called me the day of my 3rd surgery, which happen to be the day before Thanksgiving. This client I have a contract for around 13K with a balance of 8K left on that contract over the next few years. I have a similar contract coming up starting in early 2008 which will be similar through summer of 2009 this contract will have lots of travel involved also. The main reason as you can tell I am a trooper and never say never to a challenge. My gross income has risen 15K in 2007. I have steady monthly clients good for at least $3000. I just need that extra financial cushion to help the lives of other persons who are disabled.

I had never been through anything quite so devasting and have developed a real sympathy for anyone facing a disaster! We lost so much that can never be replaced.   A lot of the repairs we did ourselves to save money but certain things we were not qualified to do- i.e. electircal, roofing,etc. We have just now this summer gotten a new roof (the waiting lists were over 18 months long). We are now ready to complete the electrical issues, new ceilings and put our house back in order. We are out of money and need help!

I am very active in giving back to the community and hope some of that good karma will come back to me now that I need some help.
